# Express API Project

This week's project is to start the backend journey by creating an API using Express. The API should have at least a couple of RESTful endpoints which return either an array of data, or a single item.

## The problem

I decided to use the books.json as my data in this project. The data is stored in a JSON file in the data folder, instead of using a database. The data contains 500 books and information about reviews, pages, language etc.
